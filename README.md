This repository contains all the source code from my YouTube series [Oxide - making of a custom minecraft server](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLht_DnAZ_Av4UZwQGhz7aNDMH9pfI0ein)

It currently contains two parts: The minecraft server itself in the server directory and a proxy used for reverse engineering the minecraft protocol in the proxy directory.
